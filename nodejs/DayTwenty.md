## Goals
The task for today is involves completing your Nodejs API functionalities, API documentations, hosting and deploying it to a live server. 

## Summary
By now the following should be ready in your Nodejs application:
1. DB Setup & its corresponding diagram.
2. Required application functionalities.
3. Required API endpoints.
4. Required Edge cases.
5. Required codebase refactoring.
6. API security (Bearer token functionality).
7. Appropriate API documentation.

**Now is the time to deploy all your hard-work for the period of this 20DaysOfCode challenge to a live server and make it available for the whole world to see!**

## Deadline
On or before Monday 2nd of January 2023, 9pm W.A.T.

## Please Note
```
If needed, you will have to update your API documentation created using GitBooks so it works with your updated codebase. 
Make sure your API documentation is up to date.
```

## Instructions
- In the Github repository you created for the vending machine API, create a new branch
- The name of the branch will be `dev-production`.
- Create a README.md file in the repository for your Nodejs application if you don’t have one. If you already have a README.md file in your repository, update it with the following:
  - Appropriate information needed to run your application locally.
  - The codebase structure of your application.
  - The database structure of your application.
  - The logic of your application (What the vending machine API is all about)
  - The bearer token type used.
  - The edge cases added to your application.
  - The security measures you added to your application.
  - Link to the API documentation created on GitBooks containing all your routes and how to consume your API
  - Any other information you feel is necessary to add to your README.md file to detail your API more.

## Why Is Having An Appropriate README.md file important?
1. You are not the only one that will go through your codebase, so its important to create a guide into your application. This will aid the next person in understanding the logic and structure of your application.
2. As a developer, the need to document your codebase cannot be overemphasised, little things like a good, concise and well structured documentation can get you a job in a company amongst hundreds of applicants.

## Submitting Your Task
When you are finished with cloning each of the websites, submit the following:
1. Link to your GitHub repository.
2. Link to your hosted nodejs application
3. Link to the GitBooks documentation
4. Upload the above links in the Codevixens Academy slack channel for 20DaysOfCode #Day20.
5. Link to the social media post you made.. if any.
