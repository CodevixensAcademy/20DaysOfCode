## Day Five

### Goals
To see how well you can create custom API responses.

### Overview
In creating APIs, it's important that all API responses maintain a predefined structure as this is beneficial to  anyone consuming your API. Why? This is so that they know what to look for on getting a response from your API.  It also adds to giving a good user experience to your API.

### Summary
