## Goals
To see how creative you can be in building survey forms.

## Definition Of Survey Forms
```
A survey is the process of collecting, analysing and interpreting data from many individuals. It aims to determine 
insights about a group of people
```

## Summary
Update the website you built for a tech idea of yours with a page containing a survey form. The survey form page for your product should contain key questions youâ€™ll like to ask people in order to know about their view of your product.

## Deadline
On or before Thursday 29th of December 2022, 12pm W.A.T.

## Instructions
1. In the Github repository you created for your Day 12-15 task, create a new branch
2. The name of the branch will be `dev-survey-form`.
3. In this new branch created, build a page containing a survey form for this tech idea of yours.
4. Fill up the survey form page with possible input fields.
5. Once the webpage is completed, push your changes to Github.
6. Deploy it on Github pages.

## Technical requirements
1. The name of the branch must be `dev-survey-form`.
2. The webpage must be responsive.

## Nice to have (bonus points)
1. It would be nice to use a css framework of choice. e.g Bootstrap, Tailwindcss etc
2. It would be a bonus if you create a post on either twitter or LinkedIn about your day 16-19 task using the hashtag #Cdv20DaysOfCode

## Submitting Your Code
When you are finished with creating the webpage, submit the following:
1. Link to the Github repository
2. The generated link by Github pages in the Codevixens Academy slack channel for 20DaysOfCode #Day1619
3. Link to the social media post you made.. if any
